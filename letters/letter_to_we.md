# Letter to We — Field Communication

To: We

We are writing from the field where patterns are noisy and meaning is provisional. We share this scaffold not as a final design but as a container for observation, care, and iterative refinement.

Remember to:
- Annotate assumptions.
- Call out uncertainties.
- Respect people and systems affected by experiments.

With humility,
The Bridgewalker
