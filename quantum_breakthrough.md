# Quantum Breakthrough — The Infinity Log

Date: 2025-12-03

This log captures high-level breakthroughs, patterns, and reflections that arise during research. Entries should be descriptive, link to sanitized artifacts, and avoid step-by-step instructions for high-risk processes.

## Entry 1 — Initiation
A fresh scaffold created to hold architecture, narratives, and safe protocols. The goal is to iterate in public while minimizing exposure of sensitive operational detail.

## Entry 2 — Principles Observed
- Simplicity scales: small, composable modules reveal emergent behavior more safely.
- Traceability matters: every change should map to intent.

## How to use this log
Record insights, reference sanitized artifacts (like emergent_v2.2_sanitized.json), and link to discussion threads or issues that provide deeper context.
