# EMERGENT Framework

The Manifesto

A short manifesto describing purpose, principles, and high-level structure.

## Vision
To explore emergent patterns across systems — computational, biological, and social — and to provide a lightweight, ethical framework for building experiments, logging discoveries, and communicating field notes.

## Principles
- Openness: designs and logs are shared with context and boundaries.
- Sanitation: sensitive or dangerous details are redacted and abstracted for safety.
- Iteration: designs evolve through small, auditable steps.
- Respect: for systems, people, and unknown consequences.

## Repository structure
- emergent_v2.2_sanitized.json — The Core Architecture (sanitized).
- quantum_breakthrough.md — The Infinity Log: high-level discoveries and milestones.
- letters/letter_to_we.md — Field communications and notes.
- protocols/awakening_protocol.txt — A compressed prompt-style protocol (sanitized).
